# Inspired by elemental2's release_elemental2.sh script, this script unpacks
# the generated sources, appends a license header, and sets it up to be built,
# deployed by maven. The main advantage over the existing script is that it
# doesn't use j2cl's maven/deploy.sh, which hardcodes the repositoryId, url,
# use of GPG for deployment (sonatype snapshots doesn't require this), and
# also re-generates bytecode to match source code (just in case that were
# to matter). Additionally, this approach lets us ensure that maven plugins
# like net.ltgt.gwt.maven:gwt-maven-plugin to conform to expectations of
# downstream users.
